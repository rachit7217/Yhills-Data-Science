### Project Summary: Taxi Fare Prediction Using Python and Excel

The **Taxi Fare Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict taxi fares based on various factors such as pickup/drop-off locations, distance traveled, and time of day. The project uses **Python** and **Excel** in conjunction with **Jupyter Notebook** to build, train, and evaluate the model.

#### Data Collection and Preparation:
- The dataset, typically in CSV format, contains information on taxi rides including pickup and drop-off locations (latitude, longitude), trip distance, passenger count, and fare amount.
- **Excel** is used initially to explore and clean the data. Basic tasks like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preliminary data visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) can be performed using Excel.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- In the Jupyter Notebook, **Python** libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** are used for deeper EDA.
- The data is analyzed for trends like the relationship between distance and fare, time of day effects, and geographical patterns using visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts).

#### Model Building:
- A machine learning model is built using **Scikit-Learn**. Common algorithms like **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest** are trained on the dataset.
- Data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets are handled in Python.

#### Model Evaluation:
- The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) and **RÂ² score**.
- Finally, predictions are made, and the model is fine-tuned for better accuracy.

This project demonstrates how Python and Excel can be effectively combined for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
